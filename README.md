# My Story

I'm Sajjad Umar, a Senior Software Engineer with over 7 years of experience in Ruby on Rails server-side development.

My journey began in 2011 when I would accompany my brother to his Intermediate in Computer Science classes. While waiting outside, I was invited by his teacher to sit in. That was the day I discovered algorithms, sparking my passion for programming. Attending those classes taught me the fundamentals of programming, including control structures, data structures, loops, and other core concepts.

Two years later, I shifted my major from Electrical Engineering to Computer Science and completed my Bachelor's in Information Technology, with a final year project focused on Android application development.

I began my career with an internship as a Junior Software Engineer at PlumZ Studios, a small gaming studio, during my 6th semester. Currently, I work as a Senior Software Engineer at a multinational company and also develop free tools like [TheTestRequest](https://thetestrequest.com) in my spare time.
