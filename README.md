# My Story

I'm Sajjad Umar, Sr. Software Engineer having 4 years of development experience in RoR ServerSide development.

It all started back in 2011 when my brother used to attend his Intermediate in Computer Science classes while I wait for him right outside the class so we both can go home together.

One day his teacher asked me to come inside and sit in the back row, that was the first day I learned what an algorithm is. After that day I used to attend his classes every now and then and learned the basics of programming including control and data structures, loops, and many other basic programming concepts.

Fast forward 2 years, I changed my major from Electrical Engineering to Computer Science, done Bachelors in Information Technology with a final year project in Android Application Development.

I started my first Internship as a Junior Android Application Developer at a small gaming studio called PlumZ Studios when I was in the 6th semester.

And currently I'm working as a Sr. Software Engineer at a multi-national company, along with working on multiple free tools like [TheTestRequest](https://thetestrequest.com) in my free time.
